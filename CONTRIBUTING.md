## What should I know before getting started?

#### What Is AWS Data Exchange (ADX)?
> [AWS Data Exchange](https://aws.amazon.com/data-exchange/) is a data marketplace that makes it easy for AWS customers to securely find, subscribe to, and use third-party data in the cloud.

#### Who is Rearc?
[Rearc](https://www.rearc.io) is a data provider and one of the launch partners for AWS Data Exchange. Products published by Rearc on ADX can be found [here](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=a8a86da2-b2d1-4fae-992d-03494e90590b). On ADX we automate the (1) sourcing, (2) transformation, (3) creation, (4) revisions and, (5) publishing of datasets through ADX.

#### What are Rearc's goals for ADX?
We at Rearc are working tirelessly to lend greater accessibility to interesting and/or important datasets across various disciplines and sources. We realize direct integration with ADX, along with other AWS services, facilitates a convenient way for our subscribers to consume data. For data providers we can provide an automation pipeline, to ensure performance and availability of your data products for your customers.

#### What tools are you using within this project?
AWS Data Exchange Publisher Coordinator is primarily built with [Python 3](https://www.python.org), and use AWS [CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/), [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/) and [Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/) resources to offer a robust publishing pipeline.
